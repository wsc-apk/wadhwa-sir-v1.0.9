## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

Basic familiarity with command line is helpful, but the tutorial walks you through everything step-by-step.

### Will my website need to change?
Your website should be mobile-friendly and responsive. Backend changes are not typically required.

### Can I add native features?
Yes! This template supports Capacitor plugins for camera access, geolocation, push notifications, and more.
